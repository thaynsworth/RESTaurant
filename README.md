I want an application so our waitstaff can manage our food orders...

Overall... an employee should be able to...
  a: select a party of customers
  b: select food items the customers have ordered
  c: save a receipt

We'll keep thinking about it over the next few days and send more details when they come up.

Some starting ideas:

Food: An item of food on the menu (aka menu item)

name?
cuisine type?
what is the price?
any allergens?
Order: Join between Food items and Party

Party: A single group of people

table number?
number of guests?
did they pay yet?

As an employee, I want to be able to add new food items... so the menu can change
As an employee, I want to be able to edit previously added food items... so I can update descriptions
As an employee, I want to be able to delete previously added food items... so I can remove bad food
As an employee, I want to be able to add food items to a party as they order them... so I can keep track of a party's orders
As an employee, I want to be able to create a receipt ... so I can print it
